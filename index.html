    <p class="block-text" id="abstract">
      <b>Abstract: </b> Spectral library generation is a technique to produce libraries of theoretical spectra that are used to analyze experimental spectra gathered from femtosecond/picosecond<i> Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering</i> (fs/ps CARS). However, managing the library generation code for several molecular species and varying experimental parameters is a daunting task. To address this issue, we built a graphical user interface (GUI) that gives users the flexibility to adjust experimental parameters; while combining many iterations of the code into one, easily distributed program. We adapted the existing code to consolidate it all into one program while focusing on providing users with a robust and flexible way to generate theoretical libraries. Future work can be done to include support for additional molecular species, add quality-of-life features,  and verify the accuracy of the spectra produced by the program for high pressures.
